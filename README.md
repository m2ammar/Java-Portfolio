# Muhammad Ammar Saleem - Java Portfolio

Welcome to my **Java Portfolio**, where I showcase **18+ real-world projects** and **5 main mini apps** built from scratch. This portfolio demonstrates my programming skills, problem-solving ability, and understanding of Java fundamentals—from beginner-friendly tasks to complex real-world applications.
